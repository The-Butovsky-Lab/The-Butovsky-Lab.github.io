abstract: "To study the role of APOE variants in the regulation of microglial gene activity at the single-cell level, we utilized a cohort of male and female carriers with AD with the APOE ε3/3 and APOE ε3/4 genotypes. Age-matched APOE ε3/3 or APOE ε3/4 cognitively unimpaired carriers were analyzed as healthy control (HC) individuals. Single nuclei from frozen brain samples were sorted to enrich for myeloid cells and subjected to single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis. The snRNA-seq analysis characterized 13 myeloid clusters identifying clusters 1–12 as microglia based on high P2RY12 expression and low expression of the central nervous system (CNS)-specific macrophage (CAM) genes. Analysis of microglial clusters yielded 104,286 nuclei across the 12 clusters, annotated using known homeostatic, MGnD, and cluster-specific markers."
